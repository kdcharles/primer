# üåê LiminalWorks: Symbolic Coherence Systems

## Overview

LiminalWorks is an experimental framework exploring the intersection of symbolic physics, cognitive architectures, and biometric feedback. The project is designed to investigate and operationalize coherence as a fundamental vector across physical, social, and cognitive fields.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Symbolic Physics**: Mapping and manipulating energy, intention, and resonance using glyphs, phase structures, and coherence fields.
- **Coherence Engineering**: Tools and protocols that measure, maintain, and modulate symbolic and biometric coherence in real-time.
- **Ethical Gating**: Systems that only activate when both symbolic and biometric integrity thresholds are met.
- **Field Dynamics**: Recursive feedback systems linking personal, social, and environmental layers.

---

## Key Components

- `Glyph` and `GlyphStack` classes for symbolic frequency and phase modeling.
- Biometric modules (HRV, GSR) for real-time coherence verification.
- Ethical locks and actuators for secure, intentional system activation.
- Doctrine composting for logging and evolving symbolic fragments.

---

## Example Applications

- Adaptive personal or group coherence beacons.
- Ritualized actuator systems with ethical gating.
- Future wearable prototypes (rings, badges, or installations).
- Research into symbolic security and energy stewardship.

## Philosophy

This project does not aim to dominate or extract ‚Äî it invites a new relational paradigm where coherence, attention, and symbolic alignment guide activation and creation.  

---

## Status

üöß **In active research and prototyping phase.**  
Not yet intended for production or public deployment.
