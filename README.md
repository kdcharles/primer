# Primer

## Overview

**Primer** is a foundational exploration of symbolic physics, coherence engineering, and field dynamics. The project integrates cognitive, biometric, and symbolic architectures to study — and operationalize — coherence as a living force.

---

## Core Ideas

- **Symbolic Physics**  
  Investigating energy and information as coherent fields rather than purely particle-based phenomena.

- **Glyph Stacks & Resonance**  
  Modeling motifs, intentions, and phase-locked coherence patterns using recursive glyph structures.

- **Ethical Activation**  
  Systems that only activate when symbolic and biometric coherence thresholds are satisfied.

- **Field Feedback**  
  Real-time relational dynamics across individual, social, and environmental layers.

---

## Modules

- 🧬 **Glyph & Stack Architectures**: Frequency and phase modulation primitives.
- 🫀 **Biometric Bridges**: HRV and GSR-based coherence verification.
- 🔐 **Ethical Locks**: Permission systems rooted in both symbolic integrity and physical readiness.
- 📜 **Doctrine Composting**: Logging symbolic fragments for iterative evolution.

---

## Potential Applications

- Coherence-based actuators and symbolic beacons.
- Wearables or artifacts that respond to attention and intention.
- Secure activation systems for high-impact environments.
- Research into next-gen energy modulation and ethical field stewardship.

## Philosophy

This is not a tool for domination.  
It is an invitation to explore how meaning, energy, and coherence can shape new forms of interaction and creation — across scales and substrates.

---

## Status

🚧 **Prototype phase.**  
Rapidly evolving. Not yet intended for public deployment.
